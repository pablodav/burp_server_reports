burp_server_reports
===================

helpful reports for burp backup and restore

The new refactor doesnt use burp -a m, it uses burp-ui api to get data so you need burp-ui up and accessible.

The previous version is on tag 0.1 https://github.com/pablodav/burp_server_reports/tree/0.1 and it will not be maintained.

`VERSION  <burp_reports/VERSION>`__

1.0 version was created with the objetive to have a flexible programming to allow new features to be easily added on
next releases, also all features on this version have unit tests to ensure no break on next release.


Intro
=====

Like burp-ui is created by a sysadmin that loves Burp and would like to help Burp
adoption with it's nice interface, I'm a sysadmin that loves burp and burp-ui and would like to help Burp adoption
by providing nice reports.

I have started with those reports that I think are more critical in large deployments, but also are helpful for every
deployment.

I have also created a lot of flexibility in the configuration of those reports, so you will notice that you could change
almost every behaviour of them from the config file.


Requirements
============

Python3.4+    
pip install to install requirements listed in setup.py and also in requirements.txt    

Recommendations
===============

burpui 0.3.0+ (to be released but with many improvements in api performance and stability)    
burp 2.0.42+ (burp monitor has been improved a lot since this release)    

Use protocol = 1  with burp2 server!!!!

Install
=======

Linux::

    sudo pip3 install burp_reports --upgrade

Also is possible to use::

    sudo python3 -m pip install burp_reports --upgrade

On windows with python3.4::

    \python34\scripts\pip install burp_reports --upgrade

For proxies add::

    --proxy='http://user:passw@server:port'

*IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UBUNTU 14.04 and maybe others*
I have problems on the first try, it said `No distributions matching  the version`, and fixed it with::

    pip3 install pip --upgrade

Consideration
=============

It caches the data of burp-ui for 1h , if you need to refresh the data just remove /tmp/burp_reports_cache.sqlite

Usage
=====

Use the command line::

    burp-reports --help

Windows env::

    \python34\scripts\burp-reports.exe --help

* ``--report`` report choices report options.
* ``--report print`` (By default if no --report is given) - Print txt clients list only
* ``--report outdated``: will report outdated clients
* ``--report inventory``: Will compare with `-i input.csv` and will export to `-o output.csv`
* ``-c config.conf``: Ini file to use
* ``--write_config``: will write all default settings on config file not overwrites any existing, requires `-c`
* ``--report email_outdated``: Will send email with outdated clients, requires config.

* ``-i`` (also can be an url, the program will recognize the url and download the file from it)
* ``--detail`` it adds more info like duration, size, received to the list printed. Can be used with ``--report outdated``
* ``--ping`` it adds ping check to ``--report outdated`` only, so you can fast-check which outdated client is pinging.

Optional Configuration file
===========================

Configuration is required only to send emails. But allows you to customize the defaults used too::

    burp-reports -c /config/file/path.conf

Recommended location: ``/etc/burp/burp-reports.conf``

Auto generate a basic template: ``--write_config``

Options to use in the file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [common]
    burpui_apiurl = http://user:pass@localhost:5000/api/
    days_outdated = 31
    csv_delimiter = ;
    excluded_clients = list,of,clients,that,will,not,be,added,to,outdated,reports


* burpui_apiurl is overwritten by cmd if you use ``--burpui_apiurl``
* csv_delimiter, used for ``-i`` and ``-o``

More possible options in config:

* **inventory_columns** and **inventory_status** is used in ``--report inventory``
* **email_notification**: Config that makes possible send emails

.. code-block:: ini

        [inventory_columns]
        server = servidor
        status = status
        sub_status = status (detailed)
        client_name = device name
        
        [inventory_status]
        not_inventory_in_burp = not in inventory
        in_many_servers = duplicated
        in_inventory_updated = ok
        inactive_in_burp: wrong not active
        inactive_not_in_burp: ignored inactive
        spare_not_in_burp = ignored spare
        in_inventory_not_in_burp = absent
        spare_in_burp = wrong spare in burp
        inactive_in_burp = wrong not active
        spare = spare
        active = active
        
        [email_notification]
        email_to = root@localhost
        smtp_password =
        email_from = server@domain.com
        smtp_server = localhost
        smtp_login =
        smtp_mode = normal
        smtp_port = 25
        foot_notes = a sample notes in the end of your email


* ``email_to`` you can add a list of comma separated values without spaces.
* ``smtp_mode`` you can use normal/ssl/tls
* ``spare`` and ``active`` you can also specify a list of comma separated values without spaces as possible status.

To send email it uses pyzmail, so all options here are valid: http://www.magiksys.net/pyzmail/
I have successfully tested with smtp relay with no authentication and with gmail account,
in my case I had to generate an "application password" in my account, logon of google.

By default it does not reads any config file and tries to use the defaults in the program. (the easiest way to see the defaults is to write a config with ``--write_config``)



Inventory: Compare your clients with external inventory
-------------------------------------------------------

Default columns is described in the configuration section above, you don't need to specify it but you can change if
required.

An example in input csv (you can also add many more columns as you desire, it will be automatically appended on output, like notes):

::

        device name;status;Status (detailed);notes
        demo1; active;;should be ok
        demo2; active; spare; should be wrong spare
        cli10; active;;
        cli20; active; spare;

As the example, it will give you details only on "active" assets and will compare if it is spare or not also. 

You can use it to compare with your list of clients (useful to see if all your inventory is in burp or not).    
It can also tell you if you have clients not in the inventory

Command line::

    --report inventory -i input.csv -o output.csv

*Status explained:*

::

        not_inventory_in_burp: A client that's in burp but is not in input inventory
        in_many_servers:       A client that's active in inventory and in more than one burp server (only possible with multiagent burp-ui server)
        in_inventory_updated:  A client that's active in inventory, also in burp and is updated.
        inactive_in_burp:      A client that is not active but it's in burp.
        inactive_not_in_burp:  A client that's in inventory but his status is not in active status list.
        spare_not_in_burp:     A client that's is Active - spare in the inventory and is not in burp (normally is ignored)
        in_inventory_not_in_burp: A client that's active in input inventory but not in any burp server
        spare_in_burp:         A client that's is active spare and also is in burp.
        inactive_in_burp:      A client that's is not active in the inventory but it's in burp
        spare = spare  # Just the status used to identify an spare client in ``sub_status`` column
        active = active # The status used to identify an active client in ``status`` column


CRON - Schedule reports
=======================

burp-reports actually it's only a command line, but you can use it in cron jobs to schedule it's execution

Information:
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System_Administrators_Guide/ch-Automating_System_Tasks.html#s2-configuring-cron-jobs

Resume:

I would recommend to create a file  in ``/etc/cron.d/burp_reports``

Cron file must be configured with lines in this way:

    minute   hour   day   month   dayofweek   user   command

A template file example::

    SHELL=/bin/bash
    PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
    MAILTO=root
    HOME=/
    # For details see man 4 crontabs
    # Example of job definition:
    # .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
    # | .------------- hour (0 - 23)
    # | | .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
    # | | | .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
    # | | | | .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
    # | | | | |
    # * * * * * user-name command to be executed
      0 9  * * 1 root     burp-reports -c /etc/burp/burp-reports.conf --report email_outdated
      0 10 * * 1 root     burp-reports -c /etc/burp/burp-reports.conf --report inventory -i url/or/path -o /var/www/html/inventory_status.csv


``/usr/local/bin`` could be the most critical part in this template, as pip installs the executable there.
You can also specify the full path for executable like: ``/usr/local/bin/burp-reports`` and then will not need PATH
